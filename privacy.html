      <h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>

      <h3>EFFECTIVE APRIL 5, 2013</h3>
      <p>Participating on the MU/DAI platform means, if you so choose, sharing information about yourself with others, as well as working directly with the MU/DAI team to customize your equipment.</p>

      <p>This MU/DAI Digital Privacy Policy (USA) ("Privacy Policy") describes how we collect and use your information through a variety of digital means. By accessing or using this website, mobile application or other MU/DAI products or services (collectively, the "Platform") on any computer, mobile phone, tablet, console or other device (collectively, "Device"), you consent to our Privacy Policy. MU/DAI may modify this Privacy Policy at any time effective upon its posting. Your continued use of our Platform, products or services constitutes your acceptance to this Privacy Policy and any updates. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into, and is subject to, the Terms of Use.</p>

      <h3>COLLECTING INFORMATION</h3>
      <p>MU/DAI will collect information that you choose to give us or permit us to access. This information may include, but is not limited to, your name, image, birth date, email and physical address, telephone number, gender, contact lists, social media information and profile, location (GPS) information, activity and performance information, and when necessary, credit card information.</p>

      <p>Further, MU/DAI may automatically collect information regarding your interaction with, and use of, our products and services. Information we may collect includes, but is not limited to, your telephone number, Device identifier and hardware information, IP address, browser type and language, cookie information, system type, whether you have enabling software to access certain features, access times, referring website URLs, information about your purchases and other information about your interactions with us.</p>

      <p>We may combine information you give us with other information from MU/DAI sources, transactions and communications. This may include, but is not limited to, information from the MU/DAI Platform, direct mail, catalogs, events, products and applications, or other MU/DAI interactions. We may also combine that information with data that is publicly available and data from third parties. We also collect information about gift recipients provided by the giver.</p>

      <h3>CHILDREN'S PRIVACY</h3>
      <p>We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from children under 13.</p>

      <h3>THE USE OF INFORMATION</h3>
      <p>We do not rent, sell, or otherwise provide your personally identifiable information to third parties without your consent, except as described in this policy or as required by law. We may, however, use your information to do the following:
      Enable Your Use: MU/DAI'S Platform allows users to create custom sporting equipment. To achieve this, MU/DAI provides features and functionality to enable users to input their personal data. By using the platform, you voluntarily and willingly provide MU/DAI certain information, including personally identifiable information, which we use to enhance, customize and personalize your MU/DAI products, experiences, and communications. If you have any hesitation about providing information to us and/or otherwise used in any manner permitted in this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use Agreement, you should not use the MU/DAI Platform.</p>

      <p>Operate, Improve and Analyze: Operate, provide, improve and maintain MU/DAI'S Platform, products, and services, including analyzing user behavior and trends; Send you administrative or service messages and other information about MU/DAI; Communicate with you about your purchase, account information, or customer service.</p>

      <p>Provide and Conduct Marketing and Promotions: Communicate with you about our products, services and events, and for other promotional purposes; Administer contests, promotions, events, surveys or other features; Display relevant marketing to you.</p>

      <p>CONSENT TO THE PROCESSING OF INFORMATION ABOUT YOU BY MU/DAI: The information you provide to MU/DAI may reveal, or allow others to identify, your nationality, ethnic origin, gender, age, and other aspects of your life. By providing information to us for the purposes of creating your User account or adding any additional details to your MU/DAI profile, you are expressly and voluntarily accepting the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy and MU/DAI'S Terms of Use Agreement that allow MU/DAI to process information about you. Supplying information to MU/DAI, including any information deemed "sensitive" by applicable law, is entirely voluntary on your part. You have the right to withdraw your consent to MU/DAI'S collection and processing of your information at any time, in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use Agreement or by closing your account, but please note that your withdrawal of consent will not be retroactive.</p>

      <h3>YOUR INFORMATION CHOICES:</h3>
      <p>Accessing and Changing Your Account Information: You can review the personal information you provided to us and make any desired changes to the information you publish, or to the settings for your MU/DAI account including your email and contact preferences, at any time by logging in to your account on the MU/DAI Platform. Please be aware that even after your request for a change is processed, MU/DAI may, for a time, retain residual information about you in its backup and/or archival copies of its database.</p>

      <p>Default Settings: We have established reasonable default settings. Because Users may use and interact with the MU/DAI Platform in a variety of ways, and because those uses may change over time, we designed our settings to provide our users flexibility and stronger control over the information they share. We encourage our Users to review their account settings and adjust them in accordance with their preferences.</p>

      <p>Closing Your Account: You can close your account through your Edit Profile page. If you close your MU/DAI account, we will remove your name and other personally identifiable information. If you close your account, we have no obligation to retain your information, and may delete any or all of your account information without liability. However, we may retain certain data contributed by you if MU/DAI believes it may be necessary to prevent fraud or future abuse, or for legitimate business purposes, such as analysis of aggregated, non-personally identifiable data, account recovery, or if required by law. MU/DAI may also retain and use your information if necessary to provide the Services to other Users. For example, just as an email you may send to another person through an email service provider resides in that person's inbox even after you delete it from your sent files or close your account, any personal information you post or send through the MU/DAI Platform to other Users, may remain visible to others after you have closed your account. Similarly, other information you have shared with others, or that other Users have copied, may also remain visible. MU/DAI disclaims any liability in relation to the deletion or retention (subject to the terms herein) of information or any obligation not to delete the information. MU/DAI does not control when search engines update their cache, which may contain certain public profile information that has since been removed from MU/DAI'S publicly viewable Platform.</p>

      <p>Memorializing Accounts: If we learn a User is deceased, we may memorialize that User's account. In these cases we may restrict profile access and remove messaging functionality.</p>

      <h3>YOUR OBLIGATIONS</h3>
      <p>As a User, you have certain obligations to other Users. Some of these obligations are imposed by applicable law and regulations, and others have become commonplace in user-friendly communities of like-minded members such as the MU/DAI Platform: You must, at all times, abide by the terms and conditions of the then-current Privacy Policy and Terms of Use Agreement. This includes respecting all intellectual property rights that may belong to third parties (such as trademarks or photographs). You must not download or otherwise disseminate any information that may be deemed to be injurious, violent, offensive, racist or xenophobic, or which may otherwise violate the purpose and spirit of the MU/DAI Platform and its community of Users. You must not provide to MU/DAI and/or other Users information that you believe might be injurious or detrimental to your person or to your professional or social status. You must keep your username and password confidential and not share it with others.</p>

      <h3>SHARING INFORMATION</h3>
      <p>Sharing Information with Third Parties: MU/DAI takes the privacy of our Users very seriously, and we do not sell, rent, or otherwise provide your personally identifiable information to third parties, except as described in this policy. We will also not share other personal information not published to your profile or generated through engagement with other MU/DAI services without your explicit consent or to carry out your instructions unless, disclosure is reasonably necessary in our opinion to: (1) comply with legal process, including, but not limited to, civil and criminal subpoenas, court orders or other compulsory disclosures; (2) enforce this Agreement; (3) respond to claims of a violation of the rights of third parties, whether or not the third party is a User, individual, or government agency; (4) respond to customer service inquiries; or (5) protect the rights, property, or personal safety of MU/DAI, our Users or the public. We may provide aggregated anonymous data about the usage of the Platform to third parties for whatever purposes that we deem appropriate and in our sole discretion.</p>

      <p>MU/DAI: We may provide your information to MU/DAI, LLC, companies and affiliates, some of which may be outside the U.S. Service Providers: We may transfer your information to MU/DAI, LLC service providers to conduct our business. For example, they may handle credit card processing, shipping, data management, email distribution, market research, information analysis, and promotions management.</p>

      <p>We may also share your information to administer features (e.g. music download, race registration, or workout routine).</p>

      <p>By Law or to Protect Rights: We may disclose information upon governmental request, in response to a court order, when required by law, to enforce our policies, or to protect our or others' rights, property or safety. We may share information to prevent illegal uses of MU/DAI'S products and services or violations of the Terms of Use, or to defend ourselves against third-party claims. We may also share information with companies assisting in fraud protection or investigation.</p>

      <p>Disclosures to Others as the Result of a Change in Control or Sale of MU/DAI, LLC: We may also disclose your personal information and other information you provide to another third party as part of a sale of the assets of MU/DAI, LLC, or as the result of a change in control of the company. Any third party to which MU/DAI transfers or sells MU/DAI'S assets will have the right to continue to use the personal and other information that you provide to us.</p>

      <h3>PUBLIC SHARING</h3>
      <p>Sharing by Default. When you join or use certain services, you agree to publicly share a basic amount of information, which may include, but is not limited to, your username, city location, and profile picture.</p>

      <p>Shared by You: You may choose to share certain information. In order to participate in certain features, you may have to adjust your privacy settings and share more information. You may also choose to share your activity on other platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter. Please read the privacy policies of those platforms, because your MU/DAI activity published on those platforms will no longer be governed by MU/DAI'S Privacy Policy.</p>

      <p>MU/DAI for Sharing: Information that is publicly shared may be used by MU/DAI for promotional purposes.</p>

      <p>Protecting Information: In order to help secure your personal information, access to your data on the MU/DAI Platform is password-protected, and sensitive data is protected by SSL encryption when it is exchanged between your web browser and the MU/DAI Platform. We use a variety of security measures, including encryption and authentication tools, to help protect your information. We use secure servers when you place orders. All credit card information you supply is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted within our databases. To protect any data you store on our servers, MU/DAI also regularly audits its system for possible vulnerabilities and attacks. No Guarantee: As the internet is not a 100% secure environment, we cannot ensure or warrant the security or confidentiality of any information you provide to us or otherwise transmit to the MU/DAI Platform. There is no guarantee that information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. It is your responsibility to protect the security of your login information.</p>

      <h3>COLLECTION TOOLS</h3>
      <p>How We Collect Information: MU/DAI automatically collects information within our products and services or stored by your browser or Device. We use a variety of methods to collect this information, including, but not limited to, cookies and pixel tags/web beacons ("Collection Tools").</p>

      <p>Turning off Collection Tools: If you turn off certain Collection Tools, you may not have access to many features that make your experience more efficient and some of our services and features may not function properly.</p>

      <p>Third Party Tracking: We also work with other companies who use tracking technologies to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet. These companies may collect information about your interaction with us, including advertising. If you would like to opt-out of 3rd party tracking technologies associated with our website, please click here. Note that if you opt-out from these third party tracking technologies, you may still see our ads at other websites, but the ads will not be tailored using third party tracking technologies associated with our website.</p>

      <h3>CHOICES</h3>
      <p>Modifying or Deleting Your Information: You have a right to access, modify, correct and eliminate the data you supplied to MU/DAI. If you update any of your information, we may keep a copy of the information that you originally provided to us in our archives for uses documented in this policy. Please note, however that information you have shared with others, or that other Users have copied, may also remain visible even if you request its deletion.</p>

      <p>Communication/Unsubscribe/Opt-Out: Regardless of the settings you select, MU/DAI may send you service-related communications. To unsubscribe and stop receiving messages, please change your settings or follow the instructions in the email, text message, notification or other message type. If you have unsubscribed from any MU/DAI communications, due to production schedules, you may receive communications already in production.</p>

      <p>Data Retention: MU/DAI will retain your information for so long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce this Agreement.</p>

      <p>International Users: Our digital operations are conducted, in whole or in part, in the United States. Regardless of where you live, you consent to have your personal data transferred, processed and stored in the United States, and allow MU/DAI to use and collect your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
