		XCOR Aerospace brings practicality and cost efficiency to American spaceflight. Its engines have been redefining rocketry for more than a decade. The company is guided by an innovative approach to propulsion and the indomitable spirit of exploration and invention.
		<br><br>
		MU/DAI was asked to help craft XCOR’s story through digital and physical brand experiences that communicate the importance of their mission and our collective opportunity to shape it. In essence, we needed to create an authentic and resonant brand identity for XCOR – one that positions the company where it belongs: in the forefront of American consciousness.

		Our work began at the Mojave Spaceport, interviewing scientists and engineers. To thoughtfully articulate this brand, we needed to understand XCOR’s approach to space travel, as well as its philosophy, technology and audience.
		<br><br>
		Our designers pored over existing research while conducting field research, image studies, mood boards, wireframes and motion experiments. We were surprised by our findings. We realized XCOR needed an entirely new kind of experiential lens to share the uniqueness of spaceflight.

	<p>We incorporated virtual reality as this lens. In space travel, virtual reality becomes an incredibly practical tool. Space flight simulators are large, static machines with limited flexibility. Our Oculus Rift VR prototype created an experience that anyone can gain access to with an Internet connection, a PC and a basic VR headset.
	<br><br>
	MU/DAI’s work with XCOR helped lower the barrier to space while increasing awareness of the powerful impact this company has on space travel, our culture and our future.
