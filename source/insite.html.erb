		MU/DAI’s creative technologists applied machine vision to this project. By leveraging Microsoft’s Kinect platform, we reduced risk and cost while creating a real-world analytics platform to communicate point-cloud data and motion through color, form and depth.
		<br><br>
		The results were impressive: an immersive and responsive spatial computing experience that grabs the attention of anyone who walks by, quickly showing how Insite Software blends digital and physical behavior and experience to drive better business outcomes.

	<p>Our approach takes full advantage of human sensory capabilities. It creates an experience connected on multiple levels. The Kinect platform lent our idea exactly what it needed – the machine vision to translate physical behavior in the event space into data-driven analytics.</p>
