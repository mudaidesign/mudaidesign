		Women On Course provides an accessible introduction to golf, combined with business networking opportunities for women. The company is founded on the belief that community, acceptance and fun are the basis of successful golf instruction. This strategy blends course-play and networking events to create an extended experience that keeps players involved and engaged.

		Women On Course gave MU/DAI the opportunity to create a digital experience that focuses on attracting new players while engaging the existing membership community.

		As part of our process, we rely on collaborative and inclusive ideation. Our “co-design” approach includes working with our clients to gather ideas and insights as quickly as possible. This places the client in the midst of the design activities, with a real role in the development of the solution.

		Kimberly Cayce, the CMO of Women On Course, worked with us to tailor a series of workshop activities for her and her team. We focused on two key areas of the Women On Course experience: existing strengths that drive membership and extending the reach of educational content through digital experience design.

		Our day-long workshop generated a wealth of insights and ideas, all leading to projects that will build significant value for the Women On Course brand and experience. Our findings are reshaping the brand language through customer experiences on and off the course. We designed revised typographic, color, and image palettes, along with brand tone and an enhanced responsive website that will drive new member acquisition while serving existing members more effectively.
