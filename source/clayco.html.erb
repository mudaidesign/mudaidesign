		Never before has the construction industry been poised for so much change. The advancement of mobile devices, connectivity and sensors has opened the door for new opportunities in construction safety, logistics and productivity.
		<br><br>
		Clayco, a long-time leader in construction innovation, asked MU/DAI to create a <strong>data-driven, pilot program for worker productivity and safety</strong>.

	<p>First, we needed to understand the environment we were asked to solve for, as well as the people who would be using the technology we developed. We started by exploring the needs, behaviors, attitudes and preferences of workers, foremen and administrators across a number of Clayco construction projects. We quickly realized that construction sites come with a host of challenges – a volatile landscape, harsh environmental conditions and limited power or Wi-Fi.
	<br><br>
	We’re putting a new spin on existing technologies to design an effective, practical solution. Our approach relies on an understanding of user needs, environmental factors and technology considerations to deliver solutions that can be executed on a worksite in any phase of construction – even before electricity and connectivity are available.

	<p>Our solution helps track the movement of people, tools and equipment on a job site, creating a data-driven foundation for improving process, safety and efficiency. We’re leveraging a combination of active and passive RFID, GPS and Bluetooth LE technologies to enable activity tracking within the job site perimeter and specific work zones as the project progresses.
	<br><br>
	Our experience designers and technologists are working side by side to prototype solutions in the lab and in the field, ensuring both reliability and function. Design researchers are crafting in-depth user personas and journey maps to inform the experience architecture for future applications of the technology. This collaborative, iterative process helps us ensure that the solutions we design are reliable and effective.
	<br><br>
	Clayco projects are diverse and built upon the highest standard of human safety and construction engineering. Our work is providing a foundation for analyzing data about worker patterns as well as tools, materials and equipment use, contributing to the overall safety and efficiency of the job site.</p>
