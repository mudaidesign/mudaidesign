		Throughout our oceans and ports, the global fishing trade is facing new risks borne out of growing piracy and unregulated poaching. Policing this illegal activity requires new approaches to fleet identification, data-capture and information sharing. The impact of these activities is felt across the globe, affecting political stability and the health of our oceans.
		<br><br>
		The Salesforce Foundation, which sponsors a wide range of global philanthropic efforts, engaged MU/DAI to design and assemble the first functional version of a mobile app to meet this challenge. Powered by the Salesforce platform, our app unites global law enforcement, armed forces and coast guards, resulting in a scalable and highly efficient solution for combatting piracy at sea.

		MU/DAI drove discovery with both the Salesforce Foundation team and key stakeholders from the University of California at Santa Barbara and the Schmidt Ocean Institute. Initial discovery revealed common challenges faced by both local and global fishing fleets – how to identify, track and share information about rogue vessels that tread into sovereign water and deplete restricted fisheries.
 		<br><br>
		Through design research, MU/DAI built an understanding of potential core users and ecosystem participants. This included more traditional investigations of user environments as well as pre-prototyping to test early approaches to sequence. We asked: Was the experience fast and easy enough for a local fisherman to use, but deep enough to draw out critical data for the wider ecosystem?
		<br><br>
		We then turned to Salesforce to unlock critical platform capabilities as the backbone of the connected experience. MU/DAI assessed components such as image recognition, marine traffic databases and machine learning, integrating these into the user experience to create a simple but powerful workflow.

	<p>The native app captures images of fishing vessels that are immediately cross-referenced against a known database of registered vessels, current locations and previously tagged photos from across the globe. Users quickly discover if the vessel is known; if not, the captured image and critical notes are uploaded into the system to further extend the system’s intelligence over time. This approach accelerates real-time crowd-sharing of key information to provide better information to local and regional authorities.</p>

	<p>Named after the Japanese deity who protects seafarers, MAZU, the app was unveiled at Dreamforce 2015 to strong support. Travis Fabian, senior director at the Salesforce Foundation, described the opportunity by saying, “…Creativity can solve problems like this.”</p>
