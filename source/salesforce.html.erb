		Throughout our oceans and ports, the global fishing trade is facing new risks borne out of growing piracy and unregulated poaching. Policing this illegal activity requires new approaches to fleet identification, data-capture and information sharing. The impact of these activities is felt across the globe, affecting political stability and the health of our oceans.
		<br><br>
		The Salesforce Foundation, which sponsors a wide range of global philanthropic efforts, engaged MU/DAI to design and assemble the first functional version of a mobile app to meet this challenge. Powered by the Salesforce platform, our app unites global law enforcement, armed forces and coast guards, resulting in a scalable and highly efficient solution for combating piracy at sea.

		MU/DAI drove discovery with both the Salesforce Foundation team and key stakeholders from the University of California at Santa Barbara and the Schmidt Ocean Institute. Initial discovery revealed common challenges faced by both local and global fishing fleets â€“ how to identify, track and share information about rogue vessels that travel into sovereign water and deplete restricted fisheries.

		Through design research, MU/DAI built an understanding of potential core users and ecosystem participants. This included more traditional investigations of user environments as well as pre-prototyping to test early approaches to sequence. We asked: Was the experience fast and easy enough for a local fisherman to use, but deep enough to draw out critical data for the wider ecosystem?

		We then turned to Salesforce to unlock critical platform capabilities as the backbone of the connected experience. MU/DAI assessed components such as image recognition, marine traffic databases and machine learning, integrating these into the user experience to create a simple but powerful workflow.</p>
